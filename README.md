# Spatial IT OPML
Planet Geospatial OPML reborn for a new generation!

So I did this late last year.

![PlanetGS is done](http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ba546361f130bb42aace43abf503add1937bed41/images/c31ebedf-e733-44b5-87b1-4238304faaf9.png)

While traffic was very stable, the code was old and patched together with twine.  It was ugly, hard to manage and couldn't parse feeds very well anymore.  It was time and I think 99% of people understood.  We get our news from Twitter and Facebook these days.  I gave a link to the [Planet Geospatial OPML List](http://planetgs.com/opml.xml) and let everyone download it and use it with their own RSS reader.  But the list itself is old, most blogs are dead and hasn't been updated in over a year.  I'd like to change that.

Update: (October 18th, 2016)

I'm not sure what I'm planning here.  I cleared out all the blogs that went 404 but most of these are dead or haven't been updated in years.  Maybe I'll get something going soon but in the meantime here is an update however small.
